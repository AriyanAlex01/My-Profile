   <h1> Welcome To My Profile </h1>

     <h2> Personal Information </h2>
       <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        <p> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT. My name is from a Persian descent as I am half Persian from my dad’s side as well as half Russian from my mum’s side. However, I was personally born in New Zealand and moved to Australia Christmas 2004, at the age of 20 months and did not receive my Australian citizenship until 2013. </p>

     <h3> What are my hobbies and interests? </h3>
      <p> I am quite a big fan of gaming and have been since around the age of 4. Furthermore, the game I have played most of all is Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. The reason for this is that I really enjoyed playing it for both the multiplayer mode as well as the story mode called Subspace Emissary. This story mode brought all of Nintendo’s biggest characters together and it blew my mind at a young age. I played this game up until 2018, when Super Smash Bros Ultimate came out on December 7th as I never owned a Wii U or 3DS to play Super Smash Bros 4. In 2021, I eventually decided to build my own PC, making a GeForce RTX 3060 build which is the GPU of the system. Ever since then I have never really touched another console as PC is just too convenient and has multiple uses. Although I have a big interest in gaming, I also have an interest in watching anime and reading manga in which my favourite animanga (anime/manga) of all time is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Written by Hirohiko Araki It is a very strange story where each part features a new protagonist going on quite a “bizarre adventure” and putting an end to each villain with some characters returning in later parts. It is very enjoyable; however, it can be very sad, and each part’s ending is bittersweet to some extent. The character designs are very unique and can be a little bit questionable for some certain characters. Overall, a 10/10 animanga for me. </p>
