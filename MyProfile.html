   <h1> Welcome To My Profile </h1>

     <h2> Personal Information </h2>
       <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        <p> My name is Ariyan Aghdassi, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.  I was given the student number s3895258 which correlates to my student email s3895258@student.rmit.edu.au one and a half years ago. This is due to the fact that I originally completed both a Diploma of Surveying and an Advanced Diploma of Surveying. While deciding whether to resume Surveying as a career and enter the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying), I came to the tough decision to change my future and decided to go into Bachelor of IT. My name is from a Persian descent as I am half Persian from my dad’s side as well as half Russian from my mum’s side. However, I was personally born in New Zealand and moved to Australia Christmas 2004, at the age of 20 months and did not receive my Australian citizenship until 2013. </p>

     <h3> What are my hobbies and interests? </h3>
      <p> I am quite a big fan of gaming and have been since around the age of 4. Furthermore, the game I have played most of all is Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. The reason for this is that I really enjoyed playing it for both the multiplayer mode as well as the story mode called Subspace Emissary. This story mode brought all of Nintendo’s biggest characters together and it blew my mind at a young age. I played this game up until 2018, when Super Smash Bros Ultimate came out on December 7th as I never owned a Wii U or 3DS to play Super Smash Bros 4. In 2021, I eventually decided to build my own PC, making a GeForce RTX 3060 build which is the GPU of the system. Ever since then I have never really touched another console as PC is just too convenient and has multiple uses. Although I have a big interest in gaming, I also have an interest in watching anime and reading manga in which my favourite animanga (anime/manga) of all time is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Written by Hirohiko Araki It is a very strange story where each part features a new protagonist going on quite a “bizarre adventure” and putting an end to each villain with some characters returning in later parts. It is very enjoyable; however, it can be very sad, and each part’s ending is bittersweet to some extent. The character designs are very unique and can be a little bit questionable for some certain characters. Overall, a 10/10 animanga for me. </p>

   <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
     <h3> What is my interest in IT? And when did it start? </h3>
      <p> Referring back to my hobbies, my interest in IT definitely started with gaming when I first played Tekken 3 on a PlayStation One, ever since then I bought every PlayStation and even eventually expanded to other platforms such as Nintendo and PC. I was introduced to gaming by my brother who owned the PlayStation One at the time, he also showed me how to use a lot of technological devices such as cameras and phones. However, since building the PC that I mentioned before, my interest IT really expanded and felt quite an accomplishment after. I started moving towards IT over surveying as I enjoyed the aspects of IT much more. While surveying deals with technology and programs such as AutoCAD, it is very hands on compared to jobs in IT. </p>

    <h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h3>

    <h3> Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
      <p> I chose to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT as I had completed the Diploma of Surveying and Advanced Diploma of Surveying that I had stated before at RMIT. I chose to do those two courses at RMIT as it was most beneficial to me as RMIT is great for TAFE, therefore it made the most sense to do the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT since I am used to all the aspects of RMIT such as the campuses and Canvas as well as already having the student email and ID card established. This made enrolling into the course much easier as I had less material to prepare and complete. </p>

    <h3> What do I expect to learn during my studies? </h3>
      <p> There is quite a lot that I expect to learn to an extent. Being able to build a website confidently without struggle is something I believe I will learn how to complete while studying. Although the website itself may not be professional, it may be to a good standard that would be acceptable for anyone. I also expect to be able to do quite basic programming however, I may learn how to do some more advanced programming during my studies that can help me with the future. I would use this knowledge to program a small game as a personal challenge. While that is what I believe I will learn through my studies, I also believe I will learn a lot about databases such as creating them and keeping them updated as well as learning the basics of computer systems. While not how to build a computer or what parts a computer does, but more about the aspects of how a computer reads programs and the aspects of binary such as number systems and gates. </p>
